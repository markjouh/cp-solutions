# cp-solutions
This repository contains my solutions to various competitive programming problems on platforms such as Atcoder, Codechef, and most commonly, Codeforces!

This isn't a complete collection of every solution I've ever written; my submissions on platforms like CSES, usaco.org, and on private problem sets on Codeforces can't be uploaded using Upcode, and it's too much of a hassle to upload them manually. However, these only make up a small percentage of the problems I've solved, so it's pretty close!
